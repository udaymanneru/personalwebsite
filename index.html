            <p class = "paragraph-text">&emsp; Hi! My name is Uday Manneru, a rising senior at Hunter College High School in New York City. I've always been interested in STEM related fields, and became hooked on computer science in 9th grade. The power of computer science to solve real world issues is what motivates me to continue learning it. I have a strong understanding of automation testing, including web testing and API testing, as well as data analysis. I also have a comprehensive understanding of machine learning.<br><br>&emsp;I aim to not only learn, but also the educate. In and out of school, I have taken up various positions that have allowed me to share my knowledge to others regaring robotics, computer science, business, and even spanish. <br><br>&emsp; In college, I hope to pursue a dual degree in bioengineering and business.</p>
